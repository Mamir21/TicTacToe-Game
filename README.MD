This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with the goal of getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Easily mark your moves and see the updated board.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Choose to play again after a game is over.

## How to Play
